Hello there... This be my attempt at the "Landing Page" project in The Odin Project's foundations path. I'll update the README as I go along.

I've finished! I kinda forgot about the README to be honest. I started a new job right at the time I started this project, so I've been kinda distracted, but, I did it!

I feel like I did a pretty good job with this assignment. I definitely have a temptation to flesh this out a lot further and build in more functionality, as other student's have done, however, I am pretty keen to move on in the curriculm.

This is honestly the first time I've built something like this without someone holding my hand along the way, and I feel like I had the skills; it was pretty freaking cool.

I may come back in the future to update this, or make a 2.0 version once I've gained a few more skills. But, for now I think I'm done.

Peace,

Neo.
